Project Overview
Response to City Disaster is a comprehensive emergency management system designed to provide real-time assistance during natural disasters and emergency situations. The system integrates multiple data sources and leverages cloud technologies to deliver three core functionalities: dynamic route adjustment, automated chatbot assistance, and automatic disaster detection.
Key Features
üöó Real-Time Route Adjustment

Dynamic route optimization based on emergency events
Integration with multiple data sources (weather services, traffic data, official reports)
Safe alternative route suggestions that avoid danger zones
Real-time traffic information integration

ü§ñ Emergency Chatbot Assistant

Automated response system for immediate user assistance
Intent recognition for different emergency categories
Coherent dialogue management
Real-time data display from various sources

üå™Ô∏è Automatic Disaster Detection

Real-time monitoring of weather conditions
Predictive algorithms for potential disaster forecasting
Region-specific threshold parameters
Integration with meteorological data sources
